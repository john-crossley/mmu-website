				<h2> Blogging Machine </h2>

				<p> Welcome to my blog where I can spill my thoughts out using a wysiwyg editor. You may be wondering why at all should
				you read this and honestly I can't give you an justifiable reason why you should. In fact I feel sorry for the tutors
				marking this because it will be grammatically incorrect and will have spelling mistakes all over and make no sense. I'm not
				trying to make you feel sorry for me Richard or Jonathan which are by the way amazing tutors.. is it working? </p>

						So what to write about..? Hmm, right so we were assigned to develop a website for <strong>Applied Web Design</strong> and I found the process to be quite easy and good. As you can see I have gone with a minimalistic theme using a beautiful boilerplate called <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/" title="Visit GetSkeleton">getskeleton</a>. The reason I chosen to use this is because whenever I develop anything I start with this boilerplate. It provides you mainly with a well written CSS base. (I developed the markup) and the rest of the CSS that styled the site.
					</p>
					<p>
						My strengths are actual programming languages such as PHP, JavaScript etc. my weakness lies in design (hence the minimal design) Check the source code though its beautifully written like a poem to you Richard. (You did say don’t make it dull, if i’m starting to sound creepy i’m sorry)
					</p>

					<p>
						When I first started to write this website I thought YEAH let’s make it fully dynamic and php powered, so I can log in create, read, update and delete posts. Then I thought that’s overkill again, I always do this for some reason, so I thought NO! simple just do what needs to be done. Just incase anybody is wondering what this site was developed using? I developed it originally using Sublime Text 2 then during it switched to Chocolat and no I know you spell chocolate like so but this software is called chocolat.
					</p>

					<p>
						I designed this site to be as user friendly and backwards compatible as possible, all the features that are available to those without disabilities are available to those who do have disabilities. So hopefully this will work well for anyone who uses it, even those of you who unfortunately use Internet Explorer or any Microsoft written / built products.. poor bas***ds.
					</p>

					<p>
						I’m not allowed to write more than 500 words, as you can tell i’m running out of things to say now, imagine if we had a minimum of 500 words.. Jesus think I could get away with sneaking some Lorem text in here? Nah best not.. anyways hopefully this will be enough to satisfy the boss.

					<p>When developing websites it’s important everyone should have equal access this goes for people with disabilities such as partial blindness, blindness, colour blindness etc. So this was an important factor to consider whilst building this website site (After all it’s a legal requirement anyways) In order to achieve this I built in several different methods to help aid those who are less able to use the website to it’s full potential.</p>

					<h4>Aria Roles</h4>
					<p>These allow a screen reader to pickup certain elements of the page and allow the user to navigate to these to read the content. Because screen readers read in a linear fashion aria roles allow the user to navigate to different sections of the page making it quicker for a user to navigate to the content he/she wants.</p>

					<h4>Skip Links</h4>
					<p>To make navigation even quicker I have implemented skip links, this allows the user to quickly navigate to sections of the site as soon as the page has loaded. This way he/she can find the content they want immediately</p>

					<h4>Testing</h4>
					<p>My website has been tested on a number of devices including iPad, iPhone / iPhone 4S with Retina display, iMac 21.5inch with 1920x1080 resolution and a computer with the resolution of 1440x900 and the site responsively fits each device. and for <strong>accessibility</strong> I have tested the website using a free online screen reader called <a href="http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/wa.php" title="Visit WebAnyWhere">http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/wa.php</a> this allowed me to test and tweak my website to adhear the disability relating standards</p>
